# Amicus

Welcome to **Amicus** â€“ the ultimate real-time chat app tailored for developers! Made with the power of Next.js, Redis, Pusher, Tailwind, and NextAuth, Amicus is designed to be fast, responsive, and developer-friendly (because who else would appreciate the GitHub login joke?).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Experience instantaneous chat updates with Pusher.
- **Developer Login**: Only GitHub login allowed â€“ because real developers commit to their chats.
- **Fast and Responsive**: Built with Next.js and optimized with Tailwind CSS.
- **Secure Authentication**: NextAuth ensures your chat is safe and secure.
- **Redis Backed**: Efficient data handling with Redis.
